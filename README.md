# Learning the language of English

A english word is composition of root, stem, prefix, suffix and conjunction.

For startup, basic words should be kept in mind, that is the beginning of everything.

To extend your vocabulary, word root, prefix and suffix is priority.

So, the project should include `vocabulary.json`, `vocabulary-root.json`, `vocabulary-prefix.son` and `vocabulary-suffix.json`. that maybe a long time to collect. but i think it worth to do.

But for now, `vocabulary-yang.json` is mainly collected words from Teacher YangLiang, who is an excellent best teacher i have ever seen.

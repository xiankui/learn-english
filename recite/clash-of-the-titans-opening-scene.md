# Clash of the Titans Opening Scene

The oldest stories ever told are written in the stars - stories of time before man and gods, when Titans ruled the earth. The Titans were powerful but their reign was ended by their own sons: Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. 

Zeus convinced his brother Hades to create a beast so strong it could defeat their parents. And from his own flesh Hades gave birth to an unspeakable horror... the Kraken. Zeus became king of the heavens. Poseidon, king of the seas. And Hades, tricked by Zeus, was left to rule the underworld in darkness and in misery. 

It was Zeus who created man, and man's prayers fed the gods' immortality. But in time, mankind grew restless. They began to question the gods, and finally, rise up against them.

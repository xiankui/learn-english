# Stephen Fry - On Depression

If you know someone who's depressed, please resolve never to ask them why.
Depression isn't a straightforward response to a bad situation; depression just is, like the weather.

Try to understand the blackness, lethargy, hopelessness and loneliness they're going through.
Be there for them when they come through the other side. It's hard to be a friend to someone who is depressed, but it is one of the kindest, noblest and best things you will ever do.
